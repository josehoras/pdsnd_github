## Explore Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project uses R to explore a dataset collected from a bikeshare service in three cities (Chicago, New York, and Washington). Three sets of questions are made about the data. The topics are explored using summary tables and charts. The insights conveyed by the charts are also commented and explained.

### Files used
- chicago.cvs
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
